# Recognition_of_non_standard_tactical_vehicles_in_images
A deep learning project leveraging ResNet50 to improve recognition of civilian vehicles modified for military use in armed conflicts. Focused on tackling classification challenges of Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles (NSTVs) using advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model optimization techniques.

The performance of ResNet50-based models was notably consistent, especially for models with frozen layers, when applied to unmodified civilian objects. Frozen layers allowed the model to maintain certain features learned from large datasets, hence maintaining high classification accuracy for data that may be very different from those used in training. This feature becomes very useful in real-world combat situations where the vehicles are not exactly the same as those used for training but share the same core features. The classification method instilled into the model concepts of robustness and generalizability.
However, tests of the model showed some of the shortcomings of the models in military-based tasks of recognizing modifications on civilian vehicles for combat. They could take the form of non-standard tactical vehicles or improvised combat vehicles, where each is modified for one or the other purpose on the battlefield. The ResNet50 models showed difficulty classifying such objects correctly, hence bringing down the accuracy of the classification. This is because most of the different kinds of alterations done to civilian vehicles have not been input into the data used for training. Therefore, it is likely to generalize poorly on features and is thus not appropriate for the tasks of combat in the real world.
These indeed suggest that fixed-layer models were more efficient in finding the unchanged objects, while unfixed-layer models allow for better flexibility regarding new characteristics. However, increased flexibility to deal with new features, which were very relevant for the unchanged civilian vehicle, typically leads to inferior performance of those kinds of models in classification. This can be a consequence of overfitting in using this model with the head that had layers not frozen and was challenged with new, different data, weakening in its capability to generalize information. Conclusively explained, this model, with its frozen layers, showed itself stronger in presenting more precise results with regard to classifying unchanged vehicles and when external data is used.
Another important feature was the data augmentation process, which increased the effectiveness of the model. Data augmentation during image generation includes rotation, translation, scaling, flipping, and so on, in order to bring in much more variety in the generated training dataset. The technique also maintains class balance but enhances generalization in the model. While augmentation was done successfully, identification of tampered vehicles was still lacking a solution. Indeed, more sophisticated techniques in terms of augmentation need to be developed, given that they very much reflect the kind of modifications done on civilian vehicles for military purposes.
Further in discussing the modified civilian vehicles many of the numerous shortcomings of the model were also identified. In such serious changes NSTVs often underwent serious change that make it quite problematic to categorize them as military vehicles. Work in this regard can be from cosmetic - adding weapons and armour - to structural ones which change entirely the look and outward appearance of the vehicle. This was mostly for two major reasons: the first is inadequate training of these objects, and the second is the overall unavailability of modified vehicles in the training dataset. Improvement over that would most probably need an augmentation of those objects with a more diverse and detailed set of images in the dataset.
Therein also lies the suggestion of using a general framework to classify vehicles in military conflicts. For instance, advanced deep learning architectures such as ResNet50, supported with very careful preparation of the dataset, can give improved results. In that direction, improving the number of images that exist of civilian vehicle modification classes can greatly improve the accuracy of the classification and the adaptability of models to real-world conflict scenarios.
This research, therefore, enhanced the applicability of deep learning approaches in automatic classification of civilian vehicles used in active participation in armed conflicts. Nevertheless, more such model development and better data management will be required to solve this identification problem with modified vehicles. It includes increasing the examples in the dataset and making accommodations for even more complex types of augmentation on the developing models to classify with very high precision the type of modification performed on vehicles.
